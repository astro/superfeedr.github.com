I have always been a great fan of the iPhone (I had mine on June 29th 2007 : iPhone D-day), but I haven't found many applications that were making good use of the "notification" feature that Apple added in its last iPhone OS, until today.

"AppNotification":http://www.appnotifications.com/ is an app that allows you to receive any notification. Its creator, Fabien just spent the last day interfacing his app with "Superfeedr":http://superfeedr.com and the result is here today : you can get *real-time RSS notifications on your iPhone*.

It's quite easy :
* First, "buy the app from the iTunes store":http://bit.ly/19T8V7 : $1.99.
* Then, "create an account":http://appnotifications.com/account/new and enter your credentials into the App.
* Add the "Superfeedr application":http://www.appnotifications.com/account/apps/22/authorize
* "Enter a list of RSS feeds":http://appnotifications.com/account/app_user_connections/2619/edit which will be pushed to your iPhone
* ... _wait for notifications to come_![1]

I've added a few "RSS from Spy":http://spy.appspot.com/, as well as the "weather in San Francisco":http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?p=94123 or the RSS for "Superfeedr's delicious page":http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/url/00f1b15f8f356e11da3dc20f28a915a8?count=15, but you could also add any RSS that you'd like.

How cool is that?

fn1. If you have a superfeedr account, you can generate notifications to the "dummy feed":http://superfeedr.com/dummy.xml, in the console, as long as you add it to your feeds into AppNotifications.
