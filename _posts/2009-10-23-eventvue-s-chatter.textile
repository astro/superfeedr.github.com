Meeting the right people at conferences is *always very difficult*. Even if you're the most extraverted person in the room, most of the time, you just don't have enough time. "EventVue":http://www.eventvue.com/ is providing a very elegant way for that by helping you prepare your conferences in advance.

When we started Superfeedr, "Josh":http://twitter.com/joshfraser helped us a lot by providing a good use-case. We said it in the past, but Superfeedr is yours, and you can thank him for his feedback. We're now thrilled that EventVue uses Superfeedr for its "chatter" functionality.

The _chatter_ is a stream that contains any message that was posted by people at a given conference : they write on their _blogs_, they _tweet_, they post to _Youtube_, _Flickr_... it all ends up there. It's like *Twitter Lists on steroids*. 

EventVue uses "PHP":http://php.net/index.php and the "PubSubHubbub API":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#pubsubhubbub. I'll just let Josh saying what he likes about Superfeedr :

bq. _We're really grateful to Superfeedr for the service they provide. Polling thousands of feeds was beginning to be a huge distraction from working on our core product. Superfeedr allowed us to stay focused on the features that matter while still being confident that our feeds will arrive in a timely and reliable manner._
