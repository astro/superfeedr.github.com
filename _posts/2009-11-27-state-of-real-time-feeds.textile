As "promised last month":http://blog.superfeedr.com/Real-time/market/statistics/state-of-realtime-feeds/, here is a small update on the *real-time feeds market*.

First, I'd like to insist on the method we use to collect these statistics. For each feed, we always _try to determine what is the best way_ to get its content and push it to our users in the _timeliest manner_. 
If you were building a similar infrastructure to ours, assuming you'd support "PubSubHubbub":http://superfeedr.com/hubbub, "RSSCloud":http://blog.superfeedr.com/PubSubHubbub/api/rsscloud/RSSCloud/ and "SUP":http://blog.superfeedr.com/PubSubHubbub/Real-time/SUP/XMPP/SUP-over-pubsubhubb-and-xmpp/ [1], here is the breakdown that you would get.

Compared to last month, we *have three times more feeds* and the proportions evolved significantly.

As you can see, it's pretty obvious that there are *less and less feeds that you'll be actively polling* (still about 75% though). 

This is mainly due to the fact that we added "white-label hubs":http://superfeedr.com/publisher to our service offering.

For example, since we have our "unofficial hub for wordpress":http://wordpress.superfeedr.com/, we subscribe to a lot of "RSSCloud feeds on behalf of our users":http://wordpress.superfeedr.com/.

Similarly, we now host official the "Posterous hub":http://posterous.superfeedr.com/ and "Backtype hub":http://backtype.superfeedr.com/ (among others), which means that if you poll their feeds, you'll use Superfeedr :) As a matter of fact, *we host the hub for 48% of the hubbub-enabled feeds that our users subscribed to*.

fn1. We implemented many other ways of getting feed updates, including some specific APIs and other techniques.
