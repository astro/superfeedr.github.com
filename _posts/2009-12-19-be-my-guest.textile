We use "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll as our blog engine, and we use "github":http://github.com to host said blog. As a matter of fact, our blog is a *regular git repository*. This as several consequences, including the fact that it's quite easy for us to add "remote" contributions. If you want to write about Superfeedr related stuff : your experience with Superfeedr, but also the technologies that we use ("XMPP":http://www.google.com/search?q=xmpp+site:blog.superfeedr.com, "PubSubHubbub":http://www.google.com/search?q=PubSubHubbub+site:blog.superfeedr.com, "Chef":http://www.google.com/search?q=chef+site:blog.superfeedr.com, "Collectd":http://www.google.com/search?q=collectd+site:blog.superfeedr.com...), or even your _thoughts on the real-time web_; this space is yours.

It's actually quite easy, you just have to "fork our blog's":http://github.com/superfeedr/superfeedr.github.com repository, write your own blog post in the @_post@ directory.

The syntax is fairly simple : name a file @yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-your-post.textile@, then, add your post content. Make sure you follow the "Textile syntax": if you want to make your text *bold*, _italic_, add "links":http:// or even titles... Finally, add a top part to the file like that:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/313462.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

When you're done, you should test the layout, by using the "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll :
# "Install the gem":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/install (if you have ruby installed)
# Type @jekyll --server@ in your fork of the "blog's source":http://github.com/superfeedr/superfeedr.github.com.

Finally, do a pull-request. If we like it (we will try to keep our censorship to a minimum level, but we need to make sure your posts aren't too _self-advertising_ and are _still related_ to Superfeedr), we'll publish it!.

Done! This place is now yours too :)
