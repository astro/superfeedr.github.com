!{float:right; margin: 10px;width: 35%}../../../../../../images/superhighway.png! Because we provide a service to developers and businesses *it is quite difficult to "show off"* to people without prior knowledge of the technology. "Julien":http://twitter.com/julien51 built our website with quite some interactivity, but it is still rather hard to understand because you're going to see the gory protocol in detail.

The well-standardized XMPP with its many implementations has always made it easy for developers to use us. There's a *vast amount of tools and libraries* out there. That makes it easy to put together a demo consumer of Superfeedr notifications in very short time.

So we want a graphical app but not restrict ourselves to one platform. The web browser, where you don't even need to install anything, just click and everything's in a sandbox is the solution. That's why it has to be a webapp.

h3. How it's built

The nature of our service is very dynamic and content must be delivered quickly. That requires *JavaScript*. Despite not being affine to that language, I've always been intrigued how *AJAX*, nowadays a common web technology, can be used with a tiny glue of "BOSH":http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html to *run an XMPP client* in just your browser.

I took "StropheJS":http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/, easened XML and DOM handling a bit with "JQuery":http://jquery.com/, and made a really tiny webapp: "Notification Superhighway":http://github.com/astro/superhighway.

Log in, subscribe to feeds (or even Twitter searches), and get amazed by that millions of content producers on the "Information Superhighway":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Superhighway.

h3. Running it yourself

# Pull the code :
@git clone git://github.com/astro/superhighway.git@

#  @cd superhighway@

# Get the StropheJs code:
@git submodule init@
@git submodule update@

# Proxy the @http://localhost/http-bind/@ to use @http://superfeedr.com/http-bind/@.  The browser's *Same Origin Policy* will allow script access only to the local domain for good reason. To proxy the BOSH entry point I included a configuration file for "nginx":http://nginx.net/. [1]

# @./start.sh@ (you may need to use @sudo@) [2]

# "http://localhost:8080":http://localhost:8080 should do it :). The Interface clearly needs a little work! Please "fork Notification SuperHighway":http://github.com/astro/superhighway :)

fn1. On a Mac, I suggest installing Nginx with @sudo port install nginx@.

fn2. On a Mac, you will need to comment the @use epoll;@ line of the nginx configuration.
